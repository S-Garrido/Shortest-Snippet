# Shortest-Snippet

This is a program that searches over a file or input string for strings or characters that are specified by an input array and finds the smallest "snippet" that contains all the strings specified in the array.  I this made for my Object-Oriented Programming II class. The professor provided outline code and I would implement the following functions according to his specifications:

- MinimumSnippet.java
  - MinimumSnippet()
  - foundAllTerms()
  - getStartingPos()
  - getEndingPos()
  - getLength()
  - getPos()
